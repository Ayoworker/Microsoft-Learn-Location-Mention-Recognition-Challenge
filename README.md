# Location Mention Recognition (LMR) for Disaster Relief
## Project Overview
During disaster events, timely and accurate information is critical for effective response efforts. While microblogging platforms like X (formerly Twitter) provide a wealth of real-time updates, many posts lack precise geotagging, making them less useful for response authorities.

This project addresses the challenge of automating the recognition and geolocation of toponyms (place/area/street names) in microblogging posts. By extracting and identifying location mentions, the system can assist authorities in estimating locations for critical activities such as medical assistance, shelter provisioning, and infrastructure assessment.

## Objective
To develop an automated Location Mention Recognition (LMR) system for identifying and geolocating toponyms in microblogging posts during emergencies, supporting disaster relief activities.

## Skills Learned
1. Text Preprocessing
Cleaned microblogging posts by removing unnecessary elements such as hashtags, mentions, emojis, and URLs.
Tokenized text data and performed stopword removal for better text analysis.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Learned to use pre-trained NER models for identifying location entities.
Fine-tuned NER models on disaster-specific data for improved accuracy.
3. Data Labeling and Annotation
Developed methods for labeling data efficiently, including semi-automated approaches.
Utilized external gazetteers to enrich and validate labeled data.
4. Feature Engineering
Applied feature extraction techniques like word embeddings (GloVe, Word2Vec) to represent text data.
Incorporated contextual embeddings using BERT for improved understanding of location mentions.
5. Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Built traditional models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for sequence tagging.
Developed deep learning architectures, including BiLSTM-CRF and transformer-based models, for location extraction.
6. Post-Processing Techniques
Applied rule-based approaches to resolve ambiguous or incomplete location mentions.
Geolocated extracted toponyms using external APIs and gazetteer databases.
7. Evaluation and Optimization
Used precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and augmentation techniques.
## Process and Steps Taken
Step 1: Data Collection
Gathered microblogging posts from X (formerly Twitter) containing disaster-related content.
Preprocessed the data to remove duplicates and irrelevant posts.
Step 2: Data Labeling
Annotated location mentions in the posts using semi-automated tools.
Validated labeled data with gazetteer databases and human reviewers.
Step 3: Text Preprocessing
Removed noise such as hashtags, mentions, and special characters.
Normalized text to ensure consistency in capitalization and spelling.
Step 4: Model Development
Experimented with machine learning models (e.g., CRF, SVM) for location extraction.
Built and fine-tuned deep learning models like BiLSTM-CRF and BERT for context-aware recognition.
Step 5: Geolocation
Used external APIs (e.g., Google Maps API) and gazetteers to geolocate extracted toponyms.
Applied disambiguation techniques to handle vague or overlapping location mentions.
Step 6: Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Iteratively improved accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and additional data collection.
Step 7: Deployment
Created a pipeline for real-time location mention recognition.
Designed APIs for integration with disaster management platforms.
## Results
Successfully extracted location mentions from microblogging posts with high precision and recall.
Demonstrated the ability to geolocate extracted toponyms for actionable insights during disaster events.
## Future Work
Real-Time Processing: Scale the system for processing high volumes of posts in real-time.
Multilingual Support: Extend the model to recognize location mentions in non-English languages.
Integration: Collaborate with disaster response organizations for practical deployment and feedback.
Dataset Expansion: Include posts from other social media platforms to improve robustness.
